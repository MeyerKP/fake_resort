    <p class="main-body-header">ATV TRAILS</p>
    <p class="main-body-text">This is a bunch of text about using ATVs and UTVs on our sweet ATV trails.
      UTVs are so popular lately. But man, some of those things are expensive! I've always preferred
      the open feel of an ATV anyway.</p>

    <p class="main-body-text">When I was a young man living on our family farm we had a Suzuki Quadrunner
      125cc ATV. 125cc, I know! But that thing could zip for its size. It didn't even have suspension! One
      time my younger brother did a jump with it off a dirt pile behind the barn and the frame snapped when
      he landed! My Dad welded it back together for us. We didn't do as many jumps after that. Out of
      curiosity I recently did a little research and came to find that this Quadrunner was the first 4-wheeled
      model of what we would now call a standard ATV or 4-wheeler. Before this they had only marketed 3-wheeled
      ATVs. <a class="quadrunner-link" target="_blank" href="https://offroadingpro.com/suzuki-quadrunner/">

      inch Bass once. On the Embarrass river in Shawano county while fishing with my siblings and future
      brother-in-law. Fond memories!</p>
